## 📱🖥 Cross-Platform Support

`abetterworld` is designed with a cross-platform rendering core and aims to support:

| Platform                          | Status       | Notes                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 🖥 Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) | ✅ Supported | Primary development target. Uses WGPU + winit.       |
| 🌐 Web (WASM)                     | ✅ Supported | WASM support via `wasm-bindgen` + `wgpu` + `winit`.  |
| 📱 Android                        | ✅ Supported | NDK + `wgpu` with minimal Android glue planned.      |
| 📱 iOS                            | ✅ Supported | Requires custom build setup and iOS surface support. |

The rendering backend is powered by [`wgpu`](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu), making the engine portable to any platform with modern GPU APIs (Vulkan, Metal, D3D12, WebGPU).
